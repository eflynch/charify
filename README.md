# Charify #

This is a python script for turning a picture into a picture made of characters.

To use you need python3, numpy, and PIL

Maybe this will work
```
pip3 install numpy pillow
```

Then try this
```
./charify -i example.png -o example_out.png
```

You can add more chars to the chars folder. Just call them [char].png and it will be cool.
